Your SUNetID: <ajstorch>

Overview
--------
<It's my personal website and informs people about my interests>

Running
-------
<npm install
mongosh mongodb_init.js
npm start>

Features
--------
<Nothing specific, liking or disliking the pictures, all buttons should work>

Collaboration and libraries
---------------------------
<I used CSS styling for one of the buttons: https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples, but I had to adjust it to my needs. I also googled
how to have the navbar sticky (code in main.js)>

Anything else?
-------------
<Loved the course and learned a ton, but it would have made my life WAY easier to have the lecture recorded for the entire quarter. 
I jumped to some Udemy classes to learn JS, especially because I don't have a CS background
Really loved how quick the TA's & the professor were in responding to questions on Ed:)
Thanks!:)>
